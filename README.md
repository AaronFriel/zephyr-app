# Zephyr Archaeotech Emporium Online Store

This is the source repository for the online store of the Zephyr Archaeotech Emporium. It's used in Pulumi's Zephyr series of blog posts to discuss best practices when using Pulumi to manage infrastructure and applications.

This application is based on [this source repository](https://github.com/aws-containers/retail-store-sample-app); the original `README.md` for the source is now found in the `/docs` folder.
